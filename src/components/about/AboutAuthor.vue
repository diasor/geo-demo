      My name is Diana Sormani and I am a Software Engineer with over 15 years
      of experience developing software. I am originally from Uruguay! Love my
      country. Although I'm living in the Netherlands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Currently I am focusing on Front-End development and I am loving it. I
      have been working a lot with
      <a href="(https://vuejs.org/">Vue</a> (both Vue.js and Vue 3), a lot of
      CSS and ES6. I also worked with
      <a href="https://graphql.org/">GraphQL</a>
      as well as REST services. I like researching new techonolgies and checking
      out what is out there and what other people is doing.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also have a lot of experience with automated testing for Front-End.
      Particularly with
      <a href="https://jestjs.io/">Jest</a> and
      <a href="https://vue-test-utils.vuejs.org/">Vue Test Utils</a>. For e2e
      testing, I've played around with Cypress and WebdriverIO but my clear
      preference is <a href="https://testcafe.io/">TestCaf√©</a>.
      <br />
      In my humble opinion, automated testing is super useful and should be a
      MUST. But is not yet able to replace manual testing... So that still needs
      to be done.
    </p>
    <p>
      I normally work on Agile environments, so I am familiar with the process
      and I follow and promote GitFlow.
      <br />
      I also have experience setting up CI/CD pipelines on GitLab, although to
      be honest is not my favorite part ;)
